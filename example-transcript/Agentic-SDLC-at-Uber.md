Chapter 1: The numbers: 70% of PRs, twice the code per engineer
0:011 second[music]
0:1212 secondsHey uh let's get started. Uh good morning everyone. I'm Udai. I'm here with my colleague Adam. We'll talk about our journey towards manage software
0:2020 secondsfactory. And in the beginning in the first part of the talk I'll talk about the key building blocks that we are investing in. And later Adam's going to
0:2727 secondstalk about how we take all of these blocks to build an end to-end cohesive solution for our engineers. To set some context, we have few thousand engineers
0:3636 secondsacross 12 global tech sites. Over the last year, all of the investments we made in agentic AI have led to more than
0:4343 seconds70% of our PRs now either by local or cloud agents. And all of this led to twice the number of lines of code per
0:5252 secondsengineer year-over-year. And this extends way beyond coding and we see it in every aspect of the engineering life cycle today.
1:001 minuteAnd we are also accelerating toil at a toil reduction at a massive pace. We handled more than 250 automated migrations
1:081 minute, 8 seconds9 million lines of code automatically for our engineers.
1:121 minute, 12 secondsAnd before even the building blocks um you know one all the investments we made over the last six years on moving to monor repos moving to basil all of that
1:201 minute, 20 secondsalso laid a really solid foundation for us to accelerate this.
Chapter 2: The model gateway, and a 100 millisecond guardrail budget
1:261 minute, 26 secondsSo the first I'll cover all of these six building blocks and Adam's going to talk about a specific example and show how
1:341 minute, 34 secondsthat feature can be built end to end uh with all of these and all of these are in various stages of maturity and rollout within Uber. But we want to give
1:421 minute, 42 secondseveryone a sneak peek of what we are up to.
1:461 minute, 46 secondsSo let's go to the building blocks the six building blocks one by one. The first one is model gateway. This is one of our earlier investments. The three
1:541 minute, 54 secondsthings that we wanted to en ensure was no PII ever leaves our parimeter to any of the vendor by default and any
2:032 minutes, 3 secondsguardrail that we add here the latency of that is strictly bounded and every request that goes through this whether it's uh and we need to be able to
2:112 minutes, 11 secondsattribute per user per project and per team. So [snorts] we have a model gateway. We made sure all of our internal use cases, our coding
2:192 minutes, 19 secondshardnesses, our external use cases, they all go through one single OpenAI anthropic compatible endpoint. It goes through a series of middleares. The
2:282 minutes, 28 secondsfirst one is identity and authentication using Spire. Uh we have a data anonymizer that redacts 20 plus PII
2:352 minutes, 35 secondstypes. We have a AI guard that has five specialized models that handles various parts of safety and policy that we want
2:432 minutes, 43 secondsto ensure. And all of that runs under 100 milliseconds. We also are investing in all kinds of caching and token optimization strategies at this layer.
2:522 minutes, 52 secondsAnd every request that goes through this, we are able to attribute to a specific project in our catalog. And we can attribute per caller, per user, per
3:003 minutesteam both in real time but also in our data lake. This enables us to create all kinds of spend years and guardrails in a holistic way across our portfolio.
3:123 minutes, 12 secondsWe also use this layer for capturing audit log session traces which are then plugged into our benchmarking and all kinds of self-improvement loop efforts.
3:233 minutes, 23 secondsAnd for an engineer at Uber, you take the vanilla client, you set the project ID and we and we take care of everything else. Today we have 800 plus projects
3:323 minutes, 32 secondsinternally going through this cumulatively handling more than 100 million model requests per day. This includes both the frontier models and
3:393 minutes, 39 secondsalso open source models whether that is hosted in our infrastructure or some of our vendors.
3:463 minutes, 46 secondsThe next is how do we provide tools to all of these models. Last year when we started on this journey we had thousands of internal APIs but none of them are
Chapter 3: MCP gateway, and cutting the token tax
3:553 minutes, 55 secondsagent accessible out of the box and we had so many other SAS tools and each one of them have different way to authenticate different way to set up
4:044 minutes, 4 secondswhich is a lot of hassle for for everyone and once you end up with enough MCPs they'll all add up to and and have
4:114 minutes, 11 secondsa massive token tax similar to model gateway we have an MCP gateway that handles whole bunch of middleares for
4:184 minutes, 18 secondsfor engineers And we have an automated crawler that looks at our internal APIs and projects all of these into MCPS with
4:274 minutes, 27 secondsone single config change. And we do the same thing even for our SAS MCPS whether it's Google, Slack, Jira, all of this,
4:344 minutes, 34 secondsthey go through the MCP gateway. We h we host them, we do the token exchange. So for all the engineers, they go through one single entry point, one common way
4:434 minutes, 43 secondsto install any MCPS. This simplified a lot for all of our engineers and employees.
4:494 minutes, 49 secondsAnd then the whole bunch of token optimization strategies. We initially had direct MCP pattern. Earlier this
4:564 minutes, 56 secondsyear we created Omni MCP which is one single MCP that you install which can discover and invoke any MCPS within the
5:035 minutes, 3 secondsgateway. And couple of months ago we projected all of these MCPS into CLI pattern so that even the response
5:105 minutes, 10 secondsdoesn't eat up in your context. And of late we also have a code mode skill which is autoinstalled which on the fly
5:195 minutes, 19 secondscreates Python scripts to hyper optimize some of the top MCP token consumer consuming use cases
5:275 minutes, 27 secondsand all of this led to like now we have thousand plus MCP tools and uh just with these optimization efforts we've saved more than 40% fleetwide savings.
5:415 minutes, 41 secondsSo once we have the models and the tools, we need a place to run all of this. For many years we had devpod which
Chapter 4: Dev pods, agentified into pre-provisioned balloon pods
5:485 minutes, 48 secondsis our cloud remote environments. We we we had this because we had like large mono repos with millions of lines of code and this is how engineers work at
5:565 minutes, 56 secondsUber. And now we took what we had with devots and we agentified that. Now we need some environment for agents to run
6:056 minutes, 5 secondsfor longer period of time. They need to be quick. They need to be isolated. We can install any number of them and they need to be globally available across all of our sites.
6:156 minutes, 15 secondsSo we have a pre-provisioned Kubernetes balloon pods. When an agent requires a new environment to run, it can take one of that which is already
6:236 minutes, 23 secondspre-provisioned. It has all of the repositories already snapshotted. The search index is already built. So the agents can start working within a matter of seconds.
6:326 minutes, 32 secondsThe next thing we noticed is the the the roles of engineers are getting blurred.
6:376 minutes, 37 secondsWe used to offer a dev port per language flavor for Go, Java, Android and so on.
6:446 minutes, 44 secondsNow we need agents to work across repositories and engineers also to work across repositories. So we have a mega dev port that has all of the
6:526 minutes, 52 secondsrepositories in one one common place and this is what we use for our autonomous coding agents now. And even for our
6:596 minutes, 59 secondsnon-engineer employees, we are providing a simple way for them to get started with any of the agent harnesses in matter of seconds.
7:097 minutes, 9 secondsThen now we get to knowledge part of it and we jumped on this bandwagon earlier this year. Uh we started noticing engineers building tons of skills across
Chapter 5: A managed skills marketplace
7:187 minutes, 18 secondsmany repositories. Um one three problems we noticed was there's a lot of duplication same skill being built by
7:247 minutes, 24 secondsdifferent engineers in different discovery and configuration was a huge hassle and a lot of skills were of
7:317 minutes, 31 secondssuperpar quality. So what we built an entire life cycle around skills. So we have core core skills and domain specific skills. All of that go into a
7:407 minutes, 40 secondsmanaged skills marketplace. We have 2,500 skills there right now. Um and it goes through a whole bunch of lint
7:477 minutes, 47 secondschecks, automated reviews which ensures a baseline skill quality for any skills that we have. And we also simplified the
7:557 minutes, 55 secondsinstallation and discovery. So there is one single command to discover and install any plug-in in our ecosystem.
8:028 minutes, 2 secondsAnd based on the engineer personas, we even autoinstall some of the default skills. So the agents automatically can pick up the right skill. You don't even have to even install them.
8:138 minutes, 13 secondsAnd of late, we started working on collecting traces and comments and capturing continuous evals so that we can go give feedback back to the skill
8:228 minutes, 22 secondsauthors for skill improvements. And this is an area of big investment for us right now. and we have 2,500 skills and
8:298 minutes, 29 secondscumulatively more than 20,000 skill executions per day across our fleet.
8:378 minutes, 37 secondsThe next piece of knowledge is context graphs. Uh we we started noticing in our execution traces agents spending lot of
Chapter 6: The context graph, 40 million entries
8:448 minutes, 44 secondstime even trying to find basic context especially in our large monor repos. You need to identify where the service is located, what are the dependencies, um
8:528 minutes, 52 secondswho owns it, what kind of patterns I need to follow. And all of this context is gathered across scattered systems
9:009 minutesacross Uber. There's 20 to 30 different systems. Each needs its own skill skills, its own MCP to gather the
9:069 minutes, 6 secondscontext. And this burns tokens. This adds a lot of latency and it creates more unpredictable outcomes.
9:159 minutes, 15 secondsSo we have one context graph. We took all of the information of how Uber runs into one context graph. This has 150
9:229 minutes, 22 secondsunique node and edge types. We have 40 million entries there right now. It captures all the way from how our mobile apps are built to our back end to our
9:319 minutes, 31 secondsdata lake. All the design docs, Jira, incident bugs, everything is connected and this enables agents to quickly find the right context within our ecosystem.
9:419 minutes, 41 secondsWe are now plugging all of our skills and use cases into the graph whether it's our on call RCAs whe it's a planning or data analysis or security
9:499 minutes, 49 secondsscans and we see across all of this they we are improving uh the skills by a lot and I'm just showing a very simple
9:569 minutes, 56 secondsexample of asking a simple question of how many mobility trips in India are are cash this needs to understand the concepts of each of these which tables
10:0510 minutes, 5 secondswhat kind of cities you need to create for this SQL with and without graph we see massive improvement in tokens, turns and latency and we see that across any
10:1410 minutes, 14 secondsearlier val that we did within our infrastructure and the last thing is how do we package all of this for everyone in the company
Chapter 7: Cortana across Slack, CLI, and web
10:2310 minutes, 23 secondsto use. So we have uh our AI assistant called Cortana. All of the things that I mentioned so far, whether it's skills, MCPS and context graph, they're all
10:3210 minutes, 32 secondsplugged into that in every surface possible whether it's on Slack, CLI, web. So anyone in the company, they can ask a simple question. It can look up
10:4010 minutes, 40 secondsthe context graph, invoke any skill, check any code, check any code in any codebase and give an answer across any of these surfaces.
10:4910 minutes, 49 secondsAnd now we started allowing employees to even personalize that. You can hook up your custom skills, custom prompt and
10:5610 minutes, 56 secondshook it up into your team Slack channel so that it it knows all of the things about that team and works like a the that teammate.
11:0711 minutes, 7 secondsAnd this this is a simple example of how you can invoke the same question before in Slack. Um and all of the employ more
11:1511 minutes, 15 secondslike one or more people can even collaborate on the same Slack channel.
11:1911 minutes, 19 secondsAnd we have the just in the last one month 300 unique personas created and more than 20,000 sessions per day. I'll now pass on to Adam who'll talk about
11:2711 minutes, 27 secondshow we take all of this and build uh take and ship a feature end to end.
Chapter 8: One feature end to end, starting from a Slack thread
11:3411 minutes, 34 secondsAll right. Thank you, Ud. All right. And as Ud said, we've got those building blocks. We're going to use those to power our software factory. So, we're going to take a feature here and show it going end to end through this.
11:4611 minutes, 46 secondsAll right. First up, right, we need to have an idea, right? A good idea probably for this moment would be something around the World Cup, right?
11:5211 minutes, 52 secondsWould it be awesome if you were a writer and you were leaving a busy stadium if there was a better pickup location to get you away from the crowd? So, that's
11:5911 minutes, 59 secondsthe idea, right? We have our idea. We're jamming on it in Slack here. Let's tag in Cortana, right? That's our AI assistant to help us with that idea.
12:0812 minutes, 8 secondsCortana with that context graph can help us determine whether this is a good business opportunity to go after. So, we can go here from Slack and now open Cortana into a web interface.
12:2012 minutes, 20 secondsAnd you'll see an example here of what that business research could look like, right? What other largecale venue events have happened before? What are some stadiums that would make sense here?
12:3112 minutes, 31 secondsFrom there, we start to think about the product requirements, right? This should be probably just a North America rollout since that's where the stadiums are. We can even then bring in Cortana to help
12:3912 minutes, 39 secondsus think about uh the Figma designs. We can create some initial mock-ups, right?
12:4412 minutes, 44 secondsDo two variants here. We want to run an experiment A and B. So the the button strings here are different between the two. So we'll test those two variants and see which one performs better.
12:5412 minutes, 54 secondsNow we'll start to think a little bit about the design and Cortana 2 can help us think about what code changes we need to happen, right? What can we leverage that's in the app already? what screens
13:0213 minutes, 2 secondsand what can we leverage on the back end. Right? So this process before could take a long time. It could take weeks to get everyone aligned. Now we can
13:1113 minutes, 11 secondscompress this into a very short amount of time now. Right? And get to a prototype here very quickly.
13:1713 minutes, 17 secondsAll right. So now we got to go build this. So we we hand off from that Cortana agent to what we have at Uber.
13:2213 minutes, 22 secondsWe have a Minion agent. It's a Uber's cloud coding agent solution.
Chapter 9: Minion, and stopping short of CI on purpose
13:2813 minutes, 28 secondsAll right. So you can use Minion in an interactive mode or you can run it in an autonomous mode as well. So I'm going to show you what this looks like. Um UD
13:3613 minutes, 36 secondsmentioned the dev pod building block. So this is powered by that dev pod. So it's got a full build environment and it can work across repos. So we're doing backend changes and the front end
13:4413 minutes, 44 secondschanges here too as well. We're going to see Minion kind of progress here and it's going to stop at just creating a draft PR and it's not going to push it
13:5113 minutes, 51 secondsto CI yet. The reason being is that we were seeing um uh that this was great for doing like toil sort of workloads
14:0014 minutesbut to build more advanced like endtoend features we really need to be able to validate uh the feature first and we want to prevent a lot of extra load
14:0714 minutes, 7 secondscoming on to CI. So if we can validate sooner before we push to CI um that would be a big benefit.
14:1414 minutes, 14 secondsSo that's what we're going to see here next on validation. Right? In the SDLC, we have an inner loop. We have the outer loop. Of course, we can have these be
14:2214 minutes, 22 secondsaensified where we're shifting more checks now to happen in this inner loop.
14:2714 minutes, 27 secondsRight? So, some of the checks that initially happen that we've had there previously is like this the static analysis sort of checks. When those are detected, now we fix those. But we can shift things to happen in inter loop.
14:3714 minutes, 37 secondsThings like visual validation. So, we can launch an simulator with a skill, grab a screenshot from the simulator, compare it to the Figma specs. We can
14:4514 minutes, 45 secondsalso bring up the service and our backend staging environment and compare the front end and the backend integration together.
14:5314 minutes, 53 secondsSo now that we've moved a um now that we've done uh that part uh we move to the outer loop where CI uh typically
15:0115 minutes, 1 secondhappens errors can still happen on CI right uh so self-healing CI is something that we've implemented here where we can fix a lot of the issues that you hit on
15:1015 minutes, 10 secondsCI code review is another thing that happens in the outer loop but this is another thing that we've shifted we've moved parts of code review to happen in
15:1715 minutes, 17 secondsthe inner loop right the outer loop code review can have a powerful model use reasoning a skill to do a deeper review.
15:2315 minutes, 23 secondsAnd in the interloop, we can have a smaller model that runs uh faster with a with a with a medium model.
15:3015 minutes, 30 secondsNow, another key thing here, right, is this if this is an autonomous diff coming from minion, we want to give a human reviewer some confidence that this
15:3715 minutes, 37 secondsdiff has gone through a lot of self-improvement already, right? That not just touching that initial generation that happened, but all these other steps have happened. And so on the
15:4515 minutes, 45 secondsPR, you will have a table attached that says all these different checks that it went through, including the screenshots.
15:5315 minutes, 53 secondsAll right, so we've got a lot more code coming through the software factory now, right? Let's talk about maintenance.
15:5715 minutes, 57 secondsRight, maintenance is even more important. Um, what we have set up now is we can actually enroll our feature or skill into u our feature or ser uh
Chapter 10: Maintenance as a managed loop
16:0716 minutes, 7 secondsservice into maintenance uh skills. So these are uh some examples of those skills that we have. Uh feature flag
16:1416 minutes, 14 secondscleanup, right? We had two variants of that world cup uh modal.
16:1916 minutes, 19 secondsNow that the the B variant is no longer needed, we can have that scheduled on a loop. So the key thing here is that this is actually a managed loop that you go
16:2716 minutes, 27 secondsto, right? We don't want thousands of loops being set up across the company without any bounds. You have a managed surface that you go to to set up the
16:3616 minutes, 36 secondsloop. So it runs on Sunday when we know we have better uh CI capacity available.
16:4016 minutes, 40 secondsU we also don't want to overwhelm engineers that Monday morning with a bunch of extra diffs. We want to control how many diffs they're seeing on Monday
16:4716 minutes, 47 secondsas well. Another cool key thing here is that when that ski uh skill runs and makes those diffs, those diffs will get comments and either get landed or not
16:5616 minutes, 56 secondslanded. That's all good label data that we can use to improve the skill itself.
17:0017 minutesAnd then at a kind of monthly cadence, we're looking to see what skills can we now learn um from in our incident reviews and turn those into new
17:0917 minutes, 9 secondsmaintenance skills that we can apply to all of our services.
17:1417 minutes, 14 secondsAll right, so you've seen uh these parts of the SDLC that we've identified. There's other parts too like monitoring.
17:2117 minutes, 21 secondsHave you seen the uh building blocks that you can use to power those and the architecture underneath them? One of the other things that we're really thinking
Chapter 11: The bottleneck is now whether you should build it
17:2917 minutes, 29 secondsabout now is bottlenecks, right? We're now we're putting more strain on our infrastructure. So we're trying to anticipate where our CI capacity needs to be and make the right foundational
17:3717 minutes, 37 secondsinvestments there. There's only so many experiments that we can feasibly run as well. So that's another bottleneck. And then lastly too, right, decision-
17:4517 minutes, 45 secondsmaking, right? It's not about you know can we build we know we can probably build it now it's more of a question of should we build it all right so that's
17:5217 minutes, 52 secondswhat we have for you today and the next talk is going to be actually from Uber as well and if you want to learn more about our agentic code review aha and
18:0118 minutes, 1 secondwill be presenting that next uh in this room thank Thank you.
